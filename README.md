# Prediction of jewelry price categories 

## Objective of the project: 
By using Python for Web Scraping and PySpark for Machine Learning, the project predicts the jewelry price categories. Thanks to the Beautiful Soup library, we retrieve information on products from a jewelry site. Then, we use PySpark for data management and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Finally, we perform two Machine Learning models (Logit and Random Forest) to classify products according to their categories. The models are performed with Python and PySpark, then the results are compared.
